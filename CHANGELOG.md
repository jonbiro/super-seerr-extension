# Changelog

All notable changes to the Seerr Request Button extension will be documented in this file.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-06-06

### ✨ Features

- **RT Ratings Overlay on Seerr**: Rotten Tomatoes scores injected on Seerr browse cards and detail pages so you can evaluate titles at the point of request. Preferences Seerr-native ratings data first; falls back to confidence-aware resolution.
- **RT-Based Sorting & Filtering**: Sort browse/search results by RT critics or audience score; filter by minimum critics/audience thresholds. Unrated titles pushed to the bottom.
- **Bulk List Actions**: Multi-select titles on Seerr browse/search pages and submit them as a single reviewed batch request. Confirmation modal with excluded-titles review.
- **Add to Watchlist**: Secondary button in the flyout panel to add media directly to your Seerr watchlist.
- **In-Library Badge**: Green checkmark badge next to the media title when content is already available on Jellyfin.
- **Browser Toolbar Badge**: Green "ON" / Red "OFF" indicator on the extension icon showing connection state.
- **Feature Flags**: Card badges, detail-row injection, pre-request summary, sort/filter, and bulk actions individually gateable without code changes.

### 🔄 Full Rebrand (Jellyseerr → Seerr)

- Renamed all user-facing strings, class names, CSS prefixes, DOM IDs, and debug namespaces from `jellyseerr`/`Jellyseerr` to `seerr`/`Seerr`
- Background script class `JellyseerrAPI` → `SeerrAPI`
- Shared client file `JellyseerrClient.js` → `SeerrClient.js`
- Storage keys migrated transparently: `jellyseerrUrl`/`jellyseerrApiKey` → `seerrUrl`/`seerrApiKey` with backward compatibility
- Manifest name, description, and action title updated
- Options page and popup rebranded
- All Jellyfin references preserved (separate media server, intentionally not changed)

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **ES Modules**: Background service worker uses `type: module` with top-level `await`. Listeners registered synchronously at top level (no race conditions)
- **Firefox MV3**: FF manifest uses `service_worker` instead of `background.scripts`, matching Chrome's lifecycle
- **Native Promise API**: All `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` calls use native Promise-based API (~12 callback wrappers eliminated)
- **Shared Ratings Model**: `RatingsModel.js` (typed bundle with partial-data support) and `RatingsConfig.js` (centralized thresholds)
- **Seerr Overlay CSS**: `seerr-overlay.css` injected via manifest `css` array — matches Seerr's visual density, supports dark/light themes
- **Session Cache**: In-memory ratings cache with request coalescing (only 1 in-flight lookup per TMDB ID)

### 🧪 Test Infrastructure

- **33 tests passing**: Property-based tests (fast-check) + smoke tests + DOM-level regression tests
- `package.json` with `node --test` runner
- `tests/helpers/chrome-mock.js`: in-memory `chrome.storage.sync` mock for property testing
- Tests cover: storage migration (round-trip + idempotence), branding (zero Jellyseerr leakage), debug namespace, tmdbId passthrough, watchlist visibility & POST body, badge idempotence, ratings model renderability, cache coalescing, summary heuristic, overlay injection idempotence, SPA navigation regression

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Service worker init race**: Listeners now registered synchronously at top level — no lost messages on worker wake
- **Duplicate flyout**: `setupFlyoutUI` method overwrite fixed; `updateStatus` restored
- **Request button debounce**: Double-click protection prevents duplicate requests
- **Ratings cache poisoning**: Rejected promises no longer permanently block cache entries
- **Bulk request response check**: Checks `response.success` before counting requests as succeeded
- **IMDB selector**: Added resilient fallback for hashed CSS module class
- **Sort stability**: Identical scores use card index as tiebreaker
- **Memory leak**: `window.seerr_debug` entries cleaned up in `destroy()`
- **Polling leak**: Navigation interval stops on cleanup via `destroyed` flag
- **Options URL validation**: Rejects non-http/https protocols
- **24 additional bugs** found and fixed during two comprehensive forensic audits

### 🔧 Technical

- **TMDB ID passthrough**: `requestMedia()` accepts direct TMDB ID, skipping title search entirely
- **Bulk request rate limiting**: 500ms delay between sequential requests with live progress counter
- **SPA navigation**: Overlay re-injects on client-side route changes without duplicating elements
- **`innerHTML` → `textContent`**: Rating items built with DOM APIs; user-controlled text escaped in bulk confirmation modal
- **Error handling**: Unhandled Promise rejections eliminated from `setTimeout` callbacks; `.catch()` added to all `.then()` chains
